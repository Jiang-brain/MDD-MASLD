# MDD-MASLD
This project investigates the bidirectional association between MDD and MASLD

# Prospective association analyses between MASLD and MDD
We applied Cox proportional hazards models to assess the bidirectional associations between baseline MASLD and incident MDD, and vice versa, using follow-up time as the time scale. Participants free of the exposure condition served as the reference group. Models were adjusted for all covariates described above, and results were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We tested the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals and detected no violations. 
# Assessment of multiplicative and additive interactions
To evaluate whether the associations between baseline MASLD and incident MDD (and vice versa) varied by key covariates, we conducted both multiplicative and additive interaction analyses. Multiplicative interaction was examined by adding exposure-covariate product terms to the Cox models. For additive interactions, we defined joint exposure groups based on the exposure and covariate status, using the lowest-risk group as the reference. We then calculated the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable portion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index (SI). The 95% CIs were obtained from 5,000 bootstrap samples, and additive interaction was considered present when the 95% CI for RERI or AP did not include zero.

# Joint effect of MASLD and MDD on premature mortality
We assessed the joint effect of MDD and MASLD comorbidity on all-cause premature mortality by categorizing participants into four groups based on baseline status: (1) neither MDD nor MASLD, (2) MDD only, (3) MASLD only, and (4) comorbid MDD and MASLD. The group with neither condition served as the reference. We calculated HRs for premature death using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for relevant covariates. Additive interactions between MDD and MASLD were examined using RERI, AP, and SI. We further examined cause-specific premature mortality by grouping causes of death into 16 major categories based on ICD-10 chapters, restricting analyses to categories with more than 100 deaths during follow up .

# Metabolome-wide association analyses
We performed metabolome-wide association analyses to examine the relationships between 249 NMR-based plasma metabolites and (i) clinical indices of hepatic steatosis (FLI scores) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-4 scores), and (ii) the risk of incident MASLD and MDD. Associations between baseline FLI or PHQ-4 scores and individual metabolites were estimated using linear mixed-effects models. For prospective analyses, we evaluated the associations between each metabolite and the risk of incident MASLD or MDD using Cox proportional hazards models. 

# Mediation analysis
We used the ’mediation’ package in R to quantify the extent to which circulating metabolites explained the bidirectional associations between MASLD and MDD. Two complementary frameworks were implemented: (i) metabolites as mediators of the association between baseline FLI scores and incident MDD; and (ii) metabolites as mediators of the association between baseline PHQ-4 scores and incident MASLD.
